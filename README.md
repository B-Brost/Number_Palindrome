# Number_Palindrome

This program provides three distinct methods to verify if a given integer is a palindrome. The class Solution encapsulates these methods. The isPalindrome(x) method converts the integer into a list of digits and checks for palindrome properties. The isStringPalindrome(x) method converts the integer into a string and performs a similar check. Both methods return False for negative integers. The isFastPalindrome(x) method optimizes the palindrome check by reversing only the second half of the number and comparing it with the first half. This project demonstrates different approaches to the same problem, highlighting the trade-offs between readability, performance, and code complexity. It serves as an excellent resource for those interested in exploring various problem-solving strategies in computer science and software engineering.
